# 🤯 Demo Prompts - Blow People's Minds

Use these prompts to showcase the absurd power of your Cognitive Digital Twin.

## 1. Bias Detection

```python
twin.detect_biases()
```

**What it shows:**
- Overengineering tendency

- Confirmation bias
- Sunk cost fallacy

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯
Shows you patterns you didn't know you had.

---

## 2. Multiverse Simulation

```python
twin.simulate_multiverse(
    current_path="Continue with Restormer",
    alternative="Switch to SwinIR"
)
```

**What it shows:**
- Two parallel timelines
- Performance implications
- Alignment with your past patterns
- Long-term consequences

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯🤯
"What if I had made a different choice?"

---

## 3. Future Self Prediction

```python
twin.predict_future()
```

**What it shows:**
- Likely specialization in 6-12 months
- Technologies you're gravitating toward
- Skills you should prioritize
- Career trajectory

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Predicts where you're heading based on your patterns.

---

## 4. Parallel Selves

```python
twin.generate_parallel_selves(
    "Should I focus on research or build a product?"
)
```

**What it shows:**
- Research-focused version of you
- Startup founder version of you
- Industry engineer version of you
- How each would approach the same problem

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Three versions of you with different priorities.

---

## 5. Cognitive Mirror

```python
twin.get_cognitive_mirror(
    "I think I should rewrite everything from scratch"
)
```

**What it shows:**
- Hidden assumptions
- Blind spots
- Contradictions with past behavior
- What you're avoiding thinking about

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Brutally honest reflection.

---

## 6. Evolution Tracker

```python
# This is built into the pattern analyzer
twin.show_stats()
```

**What it shows:**
- How your thinking has evolved
- Shifting priorities
- Learning acceleration
- Recurring mistakes

**Mind-blowing factor:** 🤯🤯🤯
See your cognitive evolution over time.

## Demo Script for Maximum Impact

```python
from twin import CognitiveTwin

# Initialize
twin = CognitiveTwin()

# Add some decisions (or load from history)
twin.add_decision(
    "Used Restormer for image restoration",
    "Better SSIM & memory efficiency",
    constraints={"gpu_memory": "4GB"},
    outcome="success",
    tags=["deep-learning", "optimization"]
)

# 1. Show stats
print("\n=== YOUR COGNITIVE PROFILE ===")
twin.show_stats()

# 2. Detect biases
print("\n=== COGNITIVE BIASES DETECTED ===")
twin.detect_biases()

# 3. Simulate multiverse
print("\n=== MULTIVERSE SIMULATION ===")
twin.simulate_multiverse(
    "Continue with current approach",
    "Try completely different architecture"
)

# 4. Predict future
print("\n=== FUTURE SELF PREDICTION ===")
twin.predict_future()

# 5. Parallel selves
print("\n=== PARALLEL SELVES ===")
twin.generate_parallel_selves(
    "How should I approach this problem?"
)

# 6. Cognitive mirror
print("\n=== COGNITIVE MIRROR ===")
twin.get_cognitive_mirror(
    "I think I need to optimize this more"
)
```

## Questions That Will Blow Minds

Ask your twin:

1. **"What cognitive biases affect my engineering decisions?"**
   - Shows self-awareness through AI

2. **"Simulate if I had chosen X instead of Y"**
   - Alternate timeline simulation

3. **"What am I consistently overlooking in my projects?"**
   - Blind spot detection

4. **"Predict my future AI specialization"**
   - Career trajectory prediction

5. **"Create a startup founder version of me"**
   - Parallel persona generation

6. **"What mistake am I likely to repeat?"**
   - Pattern-based prediction

7. **"How has my thinking evolved over time?"**
   - Cognitive evolution tracking

---

## Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

1. **Start with real data** - The more decisions you've logged, the more impressive it is

2. **Show the evolution** - Demonstrate how patterns change over time

3. **Compare parallel selves** - Show how different versions would approach the same problem

4. **Highlight contradictions** - Point out when current thinking contradicts past patterns

5. **Make predictions** - Then check back in 6 months to see if they came true

## The Ultimate Demo Flow

1. **Setup** (30 seconds)
   - "This is my cognitive digital twin"
   - Show the banner

2. **Profile** (1 minute)
   - Show stats and patterns
   - "Here's what it knows about how I think"

3. **Bias Detection** (2 minutes)
   - Detect biases
   - "It found patterns I didn't know I had"

4. **Multiverse** (2 minutes)
   - Simulate alternate timeline
   - "What if I had made a different choice?"

5. **Future Prediction** (2 minutes)
   - Predict future trajectory
   - "Here's where I'm heading"

6. **Parallel Selves** (3 minutes)
   - Generate three versions
   - "Here's how three versions of me would solve this"

Total time: 10 minutes of pure mind-blowing demo.

## Customization Ideas

Make it even more bespoke:

1. **Add voice** - Use TTS to have your twin "speak"
2. **Add visualization** - Graph your cognitive evolution
3. **Add notifications** - Alert when you're repeating a pattern
4. **Add journaling** - Integrate with daily notes
5. **Add collaboration** - Compare cognitive profiles with teammates

The possibilities are endless. 🧠✨
