**Time:** 2 minutes  
**What you'll see:** Dramatic demo with sample data showing all features  
**Perfect for:** First impression, showing to others

### 2. Interactive Mode
```bash
python examples/interactive_demo.py
```
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**What you'll do:** Add your own decisions and explore features  
**Perfect for:** Getting hands-on, building your profile

### 3. Web Interface
```bash
cd web
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**What you'll get:** Beautiful web UI for all features  
**Perfect for:** Demos, presentations, daily use

## 📚 Essential Reading

Read these in order:

1. **[BANNER.txt](BANNER.txt)** - See the vision (1 min)
2. **[README.md](README.md)** - Understand what it does (3 min)
3. **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Get running (5 min)
4. **[DEMO_PROMPTS.md](DEMO_PROMPTS.md)** - See what's possible (5 min)

## 🎭 The Demo Flow

When showing this to people:

1. **Open with the banner** (30 sec)
   ```bash
   cat BANNER.txt
   ```

2. **Run the showcase** (2 min)
   ```bash
   python showcase.py
   ```

3. **Explain what happened** (2 min)
   - "It analyzed my decision patterns"
   - "It detected cognitive biases"
   - "It simulated alternate timelines"
   - "It predicted my future"
   - "It generated three versions of me"

4. **Show the web interface** (3 min)
   ```bash
   cd web && python app.py
   ```

5. **Blow their minds** (2 min)
   - Add a decision live
   - Run bias detection
   - Simulate a multiverse scenario

**Total time:** 10 minutes of pure amazement

- "What if I chose X instead of Y?"
- Compares outcomes
- Predicts alignment

### 3. Future Prediction
Predicts:
- Your specialization
- Technology trends
- Skill priorities
- Career trajectory

### 4. Parallel Selves
Generates three versions:
- Research-focused you
- Startup founder you
- Industry engineer you

### 5. Cognitive Mirror
Reflects:
- Hidden assumptions
- Blind spots
- Contradictions
- What you're avoiding

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with the showcase** - It's designed to impress
2. **Add real decisions** - The more data, the better the insights
3. **Use consistent tags** - Helps pattern detection
4. **Update outcomes** - Improves future predictions
5. **Integrate with LLM** - Gets actual AI responses
6. **Customize prompts** - Make it yours

## 🎊 Your First 30 Minutes

**Minutes 0-5: Installation**
```bash
cd cognitive-twin
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Minutes 5-10: Showcase**
```bash
python showcase.py
```

**Minutes 10-20: Interactive**
```bash
python examples/interactive_demo.py
# Add 3-5 of your own decisions
```

**Minutes 20-30: Exploration**
```bash
# Try different features
twin.detect_biases()
twin.predict_future()
twin.simulate_multiverse("current", "alternative")
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

After your first 30 minutes:

1. **Read the docs** - [USAGE_GUIDE.md](USAGE_GUIDE.md)
2. **Add more decisions** - Build your profile
3. **Try the web interface** - `cd web && python app.py`
4. **Integrate with LLM** - Get AI responses
5. **Customize it** - Make it yours
6. **Share it** - Blow people's minds

## 🎯 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need an API key?**  
A: No! It works without LLM - just generates prompts you can use manually.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Locally in the `data/` folder. 100% private.

**Q: Can I customize it?**  
A: Absolutely! Everything is customizable.

**Q: How do I add my own decisions?**  
A: `twin.add_decision("decision", "reason", tags=["tag"])`

**Q: What if I want AI responses?**  
A: Add your API key to `.env` and use `examples/llm_integration.py`

## 🎭 The Elevator Pitch
